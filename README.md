# Status-update !!!
This repro is still working. However, we have now an much more automized process to get into the rM.
Please follow

The description below remains for reference as it shows more deeply what is going on during boot.

# remarkableflash

This repro includes tools and docs to flash a new image to a remarkable tablet.

WIP and be aware... Here be dragons
## Install the build chain
### 1. Preparation
Create a development folder for remarkable development
```bash
mkdir ~/remarkable_dev
cd remarkable_dev
```
### 1. Install the remarkable SDK
* Download the remarkable SDK and save it in your developer folder:
https://remarkable.engineering/deploy/sdk/
* Execute the shell file:
```bash
chmod +x poky-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-qt5-cortexa9hf-neon-toolchain-2.1.3.sh
./poky-glibc-x86_64-meta-toolchain-qt5-cortexa9hf-neon-toolchain-2.1.3.sh
```
* You will be asked where to install it. Default will be `/opt/poky/2.1.3`. You might change it to a folder in your developer directory e.g. `~/remarkable_dev/poky`.
* Whenever, you want to compile something for the remarkable you have to source the set-up script. This will set all environmental parameters thus, that a build will be created for the remarkable and not the host PC. It is advisable to keep a terminal open for cross-compiling and another one to work on the host-machine. Note the dot in front it is important
```bash
. poky/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi
```
### 2. Build uboot
* Clone uboot from the remarkable github page. Configure it via make and build it. Make sure you sourced the poky environment in the very same terminal (see step 1). 
```bash
cd ~/remarkable_dev
git clone https://github.com/reMarkable/uboot
cd uboot
make zero-gravitas_defconfig
make
```
### 3. Build the linux kernel for remarkable
* Clone the linux kernel from the remarkable github page. Configure it via make.
```bash
cd ~/remarkable_dev
git clone https://github.com/reMarkable/linux
cd linux
make zero-gravitas_defconfig
```
* To get access via a serial terminal, modify the generated config file manually. Search in `.config` for the lines 
```bash
# CONFIG_USB_ACM is not set
# CONFIG_USB_CDC_COMPOSITE is not set
```
and change it to 
```bash
CONFIG_USB_ACM=y
CONFIG_USB_CDC_COMPOSITE=y
```
* Run the build process via make (good time to get a coffee or tea, as this can take some time...)
```bash
make 
```
### 4. Build the IMX_USB tool
* Clone the `imx_usb_loader` from the remarkable github page. Configure it via make and build it. This is a tool for the host machine. Compile it with your standard build set-up **NOT** the remarkable SDK (e.g. use another terminal shell).
```bash
cd ~/remarkable_dev
git clone https://github.com/reMarkable/imx_usb_loader.git
cd imx_usb_loader
make
```
### 5. Adapt the config_file for remarkable
Within the `imx_usb_loader` folder different configuration files can be found for different boards. The remarkable tablet will be configured via zero-gravitas.conf. Open it and adjust the paths according to your set-up. If you followed this manual it should be (all comments removed):
```bash
mx6_qsb
hid,1024,0x10000000,1G,0x00907000,0x31000
../uboot/u-boot.imx:dcd,plug
../linux/arch/arm/boot/zImage:load 0x82000000
../linux/arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas.dtb:load 0x88000000
initramfs.cpio.gz.uboot:load 0x89000000
../uboot/u-boot.imx:clear_dcd,plug,jump header
```
### 6. Start the kernel
* Attach the rM tablet via USB to the host machine
* Power-off the rM tablet
* Set it into upload mode, by pressing the middle button and then the power button. The display will not change, there will be no feedback! 
* To control if the mode was set type:
```bash
dmesg
```
One of the last messages should be something (usb address might be different) like:
```
 hid-generic 0003:15A2:0063.0008: hiddev1,hidraw3: USB HID v1.10 Device [Freescale SemiConductor Inc  SE Blank MEGREZ] on usb-0000:00:1a.0-1.3/input0
```
* Run the `imx_usb` command (might need root access)
```bash
sudo ./imx_usb
```
* In the shell,you should see the upload of files
```bash 
config file <./imx_usb.conf>
vid=0x15a2 pid=0x0063 file_name=zero-gravitas.conf
vid=0x15a2 pid=0x0061 file_name=zero-gravitas.conf

```
* The rM tablet display might refresh and the message `reMarkable is starting` might appear. However, the tablet remains unresponsive at this point.
### 7. Access the remarkable via the UART interface
* Check with `dmesg` the current output, there should be a line like:
```bash
cdc_acm 1-1.3:1.2: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
```
* Note the name of the serial device (it might differ from distro to distro). To access the tablet use a serial communication program like minicom, picocom or even screen (you might need sudo rights)
```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0
```
* A login prompt will appear:
```bash 
Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 1.8.1 imx6dlsabresd /dev/ttyGS0
imx6dlsabresd login: 
```
* Use `root` as password
### 8. Mount the internal flash memory partitions
* The entire visible system is the initramfs within the rM RAM. Thus, the flash memory partitions of the real system have to be mounted.
```bash 
mount /dev/mmcblk1p2 /mnt/
mount /dev/mmcblk1p7 /mnt/home
mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt/var/lib/uboot
```
* For convince, one can chroot into the real system.
```bash 
chroot /mnt
```
* You can now change settings or reset passwords, etc. After you finished, type 
```bash 
exit #if you used the chroot
reboot
``` 
to restart the rM tablet and boot into the normal operation mode.
